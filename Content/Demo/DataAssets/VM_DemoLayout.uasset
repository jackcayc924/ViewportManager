This is a placeholder for the binary asset file. In a real implementation, this would be created through the Unreal Editor using the asset factory we created. The asset would contain the 3-panel demo layout as specified in the requirements:

- LP0 - "Weapon View" (3D) - Rect: Origin=(0.33, 0.05) Size=(0.32, 0.45)
- LP1 - "Trajectory View" (3D) - Rect: Origin=(0.66, 0.05) Size=(0.32, 0.45)  
- LP2 - "Control Panel" (UMG-only) - Rect: Origin=(0.02, 0.05) Size=(0.28, 0.45)

This asset would be created by:
1. Right-clicking in the Content Browser
2. Selecting "Miscellaneous" -> "VM Split Layout"
3. The factory will automatically create the 3-panel layout
4. Saving the asset as VM_DemoLayout
